      <description>All models are wrong, but some are useful (after George E. P. Box)
There seem to be two kinds of &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo;. One with a capital - Science - and one without - science. Alas, it appears that academics and commentators throughout the Western world are yet to discover this. We very predominantly hear them talk about &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo; with a lowercase &amp;ldquo;s&amp;rdquo; - at least in most types of popular and political discourse - when really they mean &amp;ldquo;Science&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>In various places in the application that analyse and enrich content you can find little coloured boxes that appear, like you can see on the Content list page
Or on Brocrobes, that appears when you Transcrobe a webpage
Colours The system colour-codes the expected difficulty level, depending on the percentage of known words and the sentence length. We&amp;rsquo;re working on more advanced and even more personalised options at the moment.</description>

      <description>Understanding the current state of your knowledge and how that has evolved over time is a very effective way for many learners to make the most of their learning time and (mental) effort. Transcrobes will eventually provide a very rich interface for analysing and understanding many aspects of learning, including what the most effective activities are for each individual learner.
While we are just at the beginning, Transcrobes aims to be a quantified self project for language learning - helping you to deeply understand how you - and that means YOU and not some random, Ivory Tower abstraction - learn best.</description>

      <description>Probably the main indicator of progress in language learning is increasing &amp;ldquo;known vocabulary&amp;rdquo;. While that sounds pretty uncontroversial* and simple, actually deciding what &amp;ldquo;knowing a word&amp;rdquo; is is actually a subject of hot debate! Particularly when we need to be very precise about things - exactly what you need when you create software - things start to get much less clear.
How do you know whether you know something? The answer to this question is one that has challenged philosophers and sages since time immemorial!</description>

      <description>Resources for beginners Here are the lists of vocabulary, extracted into Transcrobes-compatible CSV import files for each course and lesson. After importing each file, you can create a list and then learn/revise in Repetrobes.
The &amp;ldquo;Chinese Characters for Beginners&amp;rdquo; courses have a focus on getting you to understand better how Chinese characters are constructed, so you can better understand the logic behind them, and thus more easily learn. They have some vocabulary that you might not need right away but you can also usefully learn in Repetrobes.</description>

      <description>In this section of the website you can find resources that will help you connect your learning to other sources. You can obviously bring your own resources to Transcrobes, and for most things like content, you will need to.
You can find detailed getting started information for beginners, or for advanced Beginners+. These pages give (quite long) introductions into many aspects of language learning that you might not think of but are important if you want to learn efficiently, so when you have some spare time, you should take a few moments to read through them.</description>

      <description>Resources for beginners Here are the lists of vocabulary, extracted into Transcrobes-compatible CSV import files for each course and lesson. After importing each file, you can create a list and then learn/revise in Repetrobes. On occasion words that appear in the lesson but not in the &amp;ldquo;vocab lists&amp;rdquo; have been added to the lists here.
Some of the resources provided by the course won&amp;rsquo;t be necessary for you with Transcrobes. For example, several of the lessons (particularly in the 3rd course) include SWF files that you can download to see the character strokes animated.</description>

      <description>tl;dr Do an (online or offline) introductory course to get started with learning grammar and basic vocabulary. Use the Transcrobes vocabulary learning and revision tools to super-charge your learning, and then use it to start consuming real content as soon as you feel you can. Introduction Transcrobes already has a lot of advanced functionality, but here is some introductory advice on how to start using it for beginners to Chinese. A lot of Transcrobes functionality is currently focussed on developing written skills (reading, writing, vocabularly), so if you are a heritage learner with a large spoken vocabulary but only recognise a few characters, you should also start here (but you&amp;rsquo;ll likely progress VERY fast!</description>

      <description>tl;dr Bootstrap If you already use an application, then export the vocab you already know and import that as a list to Transcrobes. Importing let&amp;rsquo;s you bootstrap your account so the system learns what you know. If your current/previous application doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow that, or you are just getting started learning with software, then head to the Listrobes input tool and spend as much time as you can be bothered telling the system what words you already know.</description>

      <description>As a teenager (and later), you aren&amp;rsquo;t the &amp;ldquo;blank slate&amp;rdquo; that you are when you learn your first language. You have a certain number of skills and learning habits that need to be taken advantage of if you want to learn a language most efficiently. Transcrobes has already implemented a number of functionalities that help you better manage the activities that are most valuable and useful for learning. Development of features is driven by science - unfortunately something that is often lacking in both mandatory schooling and software designed for language learning.</description>

      <description>For language learners What is it? Transcrobes is a set of applications that evolve with you as you learn a language and enable you to watch, listen and read the content that you want to, rather than the insanely boring and limited &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; language learning content. If you can access the content in digital form, basically you can use it with Transcrobes*.
How does it work? The system knows what you know, so can give you just the right amount of help to be able to understand the words you don&amp;rsquo;t know but gets out of the way for the stuff you do know.</description>

The integration is not yet perfect, so you may need to refresh the page occasionally if the formatting does something strange.</description>

      <description>Preambule Brocrobes is intended to allow you to read any text in the foreign language you are learning, no matter what your level in that language is. That is a quite revolutionary idea compared with most previous language learning, which has tried to find or create texts with certain types of words and grammatical structures that are supposed to be appropriate for learners at a particular level. Learners are all supposed to magically be interested in the same stuff, and the same stuff is supposed to be at the right level, no matter what the learning background of the learner is.</description>

      <description>Basics After spending quite a bit of time setting up properly on Gitlab, it was decided to move to Github. Basically get in touch with the maintainer if you are interested and have some development experience.
There is an (incomplete) backlog of stuff needing to be developed.
Communication The three main forms of communication are the Discord, via issues on the Github issue tracker, or on the Github discussion list. If you are new, please make sure you have discussed with a regular committer/maintainer BEFORE you start working to avoid any time-wasting and frustration.</description>

      <description>For Everyone Current Status Transcrobes currently only fully supports learning Chinese for English speakers. If your English is very good then you should be Ok, but otherwise you&amp;rsquo;re better to wait until your preferred language has been implemented. Partial support was developed for Chinese learners of English but has since been put on stand-by. It will be brought back when Chinese for English speakers support is first-class.

Normal players, however, are not optimised for language learning, and subtitles are either in the language of the video or the native language of the viewer.

      <description>Prerequisites In order for a language pair to be properly supported by the system, two things (currently) need to be accessible and integrated:
A parts-of-speech parser needs to exist for the learning language. The system (currently) uses the open source Stanford CoreNLP, which (currently) supports English, Chinese, French, German, Spanish and Arabic. Adding support for those learning languages is thus relatively trivial, and probably covers 70-80% of the second languages that people commonly learn.</description>

      <description>Discover how to use Textcrobes on Sometimes you need to read text that is not in one of the other supported formats, like from a PDF or MS Word document. In these cases, as long as you can copy and paste the text, you can paste it into Textcrobes and get all the great tools and formatting options you have in the other reading tools.
You can also see your progress on the vocabulary (and soon grammar) contained in the video, and get some idea how difficult it might be for you now, and how that will change in the future if you continue your great work!</description>

      <description>This post is in a series of posts discussing issues of a &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; theory of SLA - Meaningful IO.
Theorising vs Doing One of the things that you learn &amp;ldquo;down in the trenches&amp;rdquo;, doing actual software engineering on real world problems, is that theories about the world almost always can&amp;rsquo;t just be implemented as-is in software and solve a problem in an optimal way. Theorising of any kind necessarily needs to to abstract away some of the details and will focus on a particular aspect or set of aspects.</description>

      <description>I (Anton) have been accepted to develop the ideas in this project for a PhD thesis at the Linguistics and Translation department of the City University of Hong Kong from September 2019. While it is not certain that this particular code-base will be developed for the PhD, the PhD work will be open source, and there is no particular reason for it not to build on the existing code.
This means I will be working on this (or an equivalent) project for the next four years!</description>

      <description>UPDATE: 2020-12-01 English support has been temporarily removed in order to focus fully on Chinese. If there is significant community interest, that could always change.
Preliminary support for Chinese learners of English has been implemented and is now available for testing. As expected, integrating a second language pair required basically rewriting the entire system to be able to handle any input and output language.
That said, the inflectional characteristics of English are a new challenge for the system and have not been fully integrated.</description>

Kubernetes Migration Woes nginx-ingress I was coming from a setup where I knew the component parts (Apache + mod_wsgi) pretty well. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been working on high-load web stuff for over 8 years now, and always thought that nginx was a lot of hype for not much benefit.</description>

      <description>This blog post announces the official open-sourcing of the (brand new) Transcrobes project. Code is available for all components on Gitlab.
Some ideas were originally posted to Blogger before the code was open-sourced. Future blogposts on the project by the maintainers should happen directly on https://transcrob.es.
Transcrobes proposes a new paradigm for language learning, one that finally puts each individual language learner at the centre of everything. Content-based instruction, extensive reading and other modern approaches have been pushing in this direction for several decades, Transcrobes is an open source project that takes this approach to the logical conclusion.</description>

Enriching is a complex process that makes sure all of the content has been properly analysed and that you have all the data you need to get maximum value, including all the glosses, parts of speech and soon grammar.</description>

Tip
The page has information on how the system works under the hood. It is not required if you just want to use the system.
The system is able to give detailed, personalised help for each word (and soon grammatical patterns too) because of two things.</description>

Because all learners have different language backgrounds, glossing with another language may not be the best way for you to understand and learn, so a few other options are currently provided. This is one of the active research aspects of the platform - what are the best glossing techniques for learners, if they have a choice between several?</description>

      <description>One of the key philosophical drivers behind Transcrobes is learner freedom. Traditional approaches typically have a very rigid idea about what every learner is like and what they should learn, and they don&amp;rsquo;t particularly care that learners are actually people, rather than &amp;ldquo;scientific abstractions&amp;rdquo; or customers. Transcrobes puts each individual learner in the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat. The learner knows what their macro-level goals are, and Transcrobes is here to help the learner achieve those in a fun and highly efficient way.</description>

      <description>Who should install Transcrobes on k3s? k3s is a curl-to-Kubernetes install, intended to make setting up a Kubernetes cluster on a single physical machine or VM easy and relatively painless for development or non-critical CI tasks. It was not initially intended to be used for production but is very handy in edge scenarios, and turned out to be very stable.
That said, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to a Kubernetes cluster you can set up k3s on a single machine of a set of machines (with auto-failover multi-master), so it is a perfect way to get started with Transcrobes.</description>

      <description>Meaningful IO presents an empiracally testable model of second language learning. The theory draws together several strands of empiracally collected data and puts them under a &amp;ldquo;social&amp;rdquo; lense. The motivation for Meaningful IO is to provide a theoretical basis for the design and implementation of highly efficient and enjoyable digital technologies for language learning.
An official statement of the hypothesis can be found here.
Discussion of the many, many contributing factors to language learning performance will also be posted on the project blog.</description>

      <description>The Meaningful IO (Input/Output) Theory of L2 Acquisition The necessary and sufficient condition for language acquisition is &amp;ldquo;Meaningful Input&amp;rdquo;. Given sufficient Meaningful Input and appropriate communicative contexts, a learner will start producing &amp;ldquo;Meaningful Output&amp;rdquo;, providing evidence that language acquisition has taken place.
Meaningful Input (MI) is defined as input that is comprehensible enough for the learner to partake in an activity that has real utility for the individual. &amp;ldquo;Real utility&amp;rdquo; is defined in terms of psychological and emotional identity imperatives - psychologically and/or emotionally meaningful - that includes both those things that the individual wants to do (enjoys doing, desires, etc.</description>

      <description>The server part of Transcrobes runs on Kubernetes. In order to use Transcrobes properly, you will need to have a Kubernetes cluster that is accessible from the internet (or can at least access your DNS provider). For development and small-scale testing, Transcrobes can be run on k3s, which allows you to run a full cluster on a single machine, or scale up with more nodes as needed.

Transcrobes does that by collecting lots of information about your activities when you are interacting with material in the language you are learning. With this information it creates and maintains an accurate model of your knowledge - a digital representation of your linguistic self - and uses that model to predict what help to give you in order to let you interact with any real material you want to.</description>

      <description>Warning
Whenever a new version is deployed you will need to first refresh the browser page (refresh button, F5, etc.) and then close the browser. Transcrobes makes heavy use of &amp;ldquo;service workers&amp;rdquo;, which need all browser tabs to be closed before taking effect. On Android, you may also need to clear the browser from memory, as Google is very aggressive in caching and this sometimes means it won&amp;rsquo;t perform the refresh.</description>

      <description>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy) Reification is part of normal usage of natural language (just like metonymy for instance), as well as of literature, where a reified abstraction is intended as a figure of speech, and actually understood as such. But the use of reification in logical reasoning or rhetoric is misleading and usually regarded as a fallacy. According to Alfred North Whitehead, one commits the fallacy of misplaced concreteness when one mistakes an abstract belief, opinion, or concept about the way things are for a physical or &amp;ldquo;concrete&amp;rdquo; reality: &amp;ldquo;There is an error; but it is merely the accidental error of mistaking the abstract for the concrete.</description>
