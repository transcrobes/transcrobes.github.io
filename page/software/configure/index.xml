      <description>Contents are created by first importing a supported file format, and then telling the system to enrich them. After enriching you can use boocrobes to read ebooks and moocrobes to watch videos.
Enriching is a complex process that makes sure all of the content has been properly analysed and that you have all the data you need to get maximum value, including all the glosses, parts of speech and soon grammar.</description>

      <description>A primary goal of the system is to &amp;ldquo;increase the bandwidth to the brain&amp;rdquo; - giving you exactly the extra information you need to be able to understand and also to learn most efficiently.

      <description>You can currently export all the data that the system records and processes about your activity on the platform. These are exported in CSV format, and could be used in a spreadsheet app like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel for making more complicated graphs than we provide today. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to send us your suggestions if you think you have a graph that others might like, so we can implement it directly on the platform.</description>

      <description>You can configure these options wherever that makes sense on the content screens.
Because all learners have different language backgrounds, glossing with another language may not be the best way for you to understand and learn, so a few other options are currently provided. This is one of the active research aspects of the platform - what are the best glossing techniques for learners, if they have a choice between several?</description>

      <description>One of the key philosophical drivers behind Transcrobes is learner freedom. Traditional approaches typically have a very rigid idea about what every learner is like and what they should learn, and they don&amp;rsquo;t particularly care that learners are actually people, rather than &amp;ldquo;scientific abstractions&amp;rdquo; or customers. Transcrobes puts each individual learner in the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat. The learner knows what their macro-level goals are, and Transcrobes is here to help the learner achieve those in a fun and highly efficient way.</description>

      <description>Lists of vocabulary and content can be imported into Transcrobes.
When files are imported, they are parsed and analysed, and important information is stored about them. These analyses can then be used for creating word lists. Word lists are the basis for several Transcrobes features, including vocabulary revision and setting goals, with more to come soon. Depending on the file type, imports of the appropriate type will appear as ebooks or media/video (for subtitles).</description>

      <description>Listrobes is an input interface that allows you to indicate how well you know words very quickly. It can be used with or without the imports system to very quickly train the system, meaning onboarding can be very quick.
By default the system presents you with a list of the most common words, most common first, according to the University of Ghent &amp;ldquo;Open Subtitles ZH&amp;rdquo; (SUBTLEX-CH) list. This list is based on word frequencies in subtitles, which they argue is the closest to real spoken language (better than other lists anyway!</description>

      <description>The preferences page allows you to configure the system with any system-wide preferences that aren&amp;rsquo;t directly related to a given tool (e.g, Repetrobes-specific preferences are configured directly in the tool).
Dark mode Dark mode is now fully supported. There is a known issue personalising text and gloss colour in boocrobes that is being worked on.</description>

      <description>Each interface allows you to configure the reading aids (including for subtitles) in a fairly standard way, with additions whether that makes sense.
Each content screen has a button to take you to the specific configuration for it. Have a play and find what works for you best!
Main font configuration Here you can choose to override the default fonts in the interfaces where that makes sense, like boocrobes and moocrobes.</description>

Whenever a new version is deployed you will need to first refresh the browser page (refresh button, F5, etc.) and then close the browser. Transcrobes makes heavy use of &amp;ldquo;service workers&amp;rdquo;, which need all browser tabs to be closed before taking effect. On Android, you may also need to clear the browser from memory, as Google is very aggressive in caching and this sometimes means it won&amp;rsquo;t perform the refresh.</description>

      <description>Personalised dictionaries may be imported and used with various parts of the system, including the comprehension aids (glosses, mouseovers, popups, etc.) and active learning tools (Repetrobes, etc.).
The system currently supports importing dictionaries in the CSV format with a fixed format. In-place editing of dictionaries will be made available at a later date.

      <guid>/page/software/configure/wordlists/</guid>
      <description>Wordlists are created by importing and analysing texts, then directing the system to create a list from the imported data. Texts can be simple lists of words (CSV or TXT are currently supported, more soon), or actual content (currently EPUB ebooks and SRT/VTT subtitles formats are supported, more soon). That makes it easy to both study lists like you might get for an exam, or a chapter in a textbook, but also content.</description>
