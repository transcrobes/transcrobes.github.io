      <description>Preambule Brocrobes is intended to allow you to read any text in the foreign language you are learning, no matter what your level in that language is. That is a quite revolutionary idea compared with most previous language learning, which has tried to find or create texts with certain types of words and grammatical structures that are supposed to be appropriate for learners at a particular level. Learners are all supposed to magically be interested in the same stuff, and the same stuff is supposed to be at the right level, no matter what the learning background of the learner is.</description>

      <description>There are now two main ways to interact with Transcrobes - the interactive website and the Chrome browser extension.
Many more integrations are planned, such as for online video streaming platforms (Netflix, Youtube, etc.). Here you will find links to installation and configuration documentation for client applications, and up-to-date information on what applications we plan to support in the near future.
Throughout the site, &amp;ldquo;Chrome (and compatible)&amp;rdquo; means Chromium-based browsers, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Yandex Browser, vanilla Chromium, etc.</description>
