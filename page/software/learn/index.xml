      <description>Transcrobes already has a lot of advanced functionality, so here is some introductory advice on how to start using it for beginners to Chinese. A lot of Transcrobes functionality is currently focussed on developing written skills (reading, writing, vocabularly), so if you are a heritage learner with a large spoken vocabulary but only recognise a few characters, you should also start here (but you&amp;rsquo;ll likely progress VERY fast!).
If you already know around 1000+ words (700+ characters) or more (HSK 4 and above), then you should start here.</description>

      <title>Getting started as an intermediate learner</title>

      <description>In addition to the vocabulary work that you started when you first started learning and should still be doing, at some point in your learning, some teacher, book, or site will no doubt tell you (probably already) to start trying to do some &amp;ldquo;extensive reading&amp;rdquo;, or possibly to watch movies, listen to music, etc. You may well have a dedicated &amp;ldquo;extensive reading&amp;rdquo; course if you are late intermediate or advanced. This gives you exposure to new vocabulary and grammar, and helps to cement the learning you have done in class with &amp;ldquo;real-life&amp;rdquo; usages of the words and grammar.</description>

      <description>Boocrobes Boocrobes allows you to read ebooks in the EPUB format using personalised comprehension aids, including when you are offline. The module is a (very slightly) adapted version of the amazing open source javascript &amp;ldquo;Readium V2&amp;rdquo; R2D2BC reader developed by Aferdita Muriqi, with the addition of the special Transcrobes sauce that connects you to the model the system has of your language knowledge. The integration is not yet perfect, so you may need to refresh the page occasionally if the formatting does something strange.</description>

      <description>Brocrobes is a browser extension that allows you to enrich any webpage with the your own, personalised help. When you click on the extension button, the extension will look for all text in the language you are learning on the page, and send that to the server. The server will then get context-based definitions for all the words, and translations for all the sentences, and send that back to the browser.</description>

      <description>See here for more details on the scientific theories behind the Transcrobes project.
Getting Started Beginners
Advanced Beginners+
Supported Activities Meta-learning The development focus until now has been on making extensive content consumption tools (web, ebooks, video) available and starting to collect data. notrobes (also see below) already has some basic information on what the system knows about the learner&amp;rsquo;s vocabulary knowledge, including the number of times the word has been seen, definitions looked up, etc.</description>

      <description>Authentic video, particularly supported by subtitles, can be a highly effective language learning tool. Normal players, however, are not optimised for language learning, and subtitles are either in the language of the video or the native language of the viewer. Also, very few platforms enrich subtitles with hypertext features (clickable definitions, etc.) and no other platforms gloss only the words that the learner doesn&amp;rsquo;t know.
You can access the video content from the Contents menu</description>

      <description>Notrobes allows you to search for words (individual characters that are not words and radicals coming soon), and gives you significant amounts of information about those words, including your interaction with them.
Using Notrobes     Simply enter a word in the language you are learning into the word entry textbox and the system will go off and get tons of information about the word and the component parts of the word.</description>

      <description>Repetrobes is a digital flashcard (spaced repetition system), originally inspired by Anki, and also (currently) using a modified version of the SuperMemo 2 algorithm.
Work has started on a very significantly optimised, personalised, behaviour-based, AI-powered version, which will be integrated soon. This new version will take into account all the information the system has on you, not just your responses in the tool, making it a LOT more accurate and powerful.</description>
