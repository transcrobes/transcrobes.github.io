      <description>Resources for beginners Here are the lists of vocabulary, extracted into Transcrobes-compatible CSV import files for each course and lesson. After importing each file, you can create a list and then learn/revise in Repetrobes.
The &amp;ldquo;Chinese Characters for Beginners&amp;rdquo; courses have a focus on getting you to understand better how Chinese characters are constructed, so you can better understand the logic behind them, and thus more easily learn. They have some vocabulary that you might not need right away but you can also usefully learn in Repetrobes.</description>

      <description>In this section of the website you can find resources that will help you connect your learning to other sources. You can obviously bring your own resources to Transcrobes, and for most things like content, you will need to.
You can find detailed getting started information for beginners, or for advanced Beginners+. These pages give (quite long) introductions into many aspects of language learning that you might not think of but are important if you want to learn efficiently, so when you have some spare time, you should take a few moments to read through them.</description>

      <description>Resources for beginners Here are the lists of vocabulary, extracted into Transcrobes-compatible CSV import files for each course and lesson. After importing each file, you can create a list and then learn/revise in Repetrobes. On occasion words that appear in the lesson but not in the &amp;ldquo;vocab lists&amp;rdquo; have been added to the lists here.
Some of the resources provided by the course won&amp;rsquo;t be necessary for you with Transcrobes. For example, several of the lessons (particularly in the 3rd course) include SWF files that you can download to see the character strokes animated.</description>

      <description>For language learners What is it? Transcrobes is a set of applications that evolve with you as you learn a language and enable you to watch, listen and read the content that you want to, rather than the insanely boring and limited &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; language learning content. If you can access the content in digital form, basically you can use it with Transcrobes*.
How does it work? The system knows what you know, so can give you just the right amount of help to be able to understand the words you don&amp;rsquo;t know but gets out of the way for the stuff you do know.</description>

      <description>Preambule Brocrobes is intended to allow you to read any text in the foreign language you are learning, no matter what your level in that language is. That is a quite revolutionary idea compared with most previous language learning, which has tried to find or create texts with certain types of words and grammatical structures that are supposed to be appropriate for learners at a particular level. Learners are all supposed to magically be interested in the same stuff, and the same stuff is supposed to be at the right level, no matter what the learning background of the learner is.</description>

      <description>Basics After spending quite a bit of time setting up properly on Gitlab, it was decided to move to Github. Basically get in touch with the maintainer if you are interested and have some development experience.
There is an (incomplete) backlog of stuff needing to be developed.
Communication The two main forms of communication are via issues on the Github issue tracker, or on the discussion list. If you are new, please make sure you have discussed with a regular committer/maintainer BEFORE you start working to avoid any time-wasting and frustration.</description>

      <description>For Everyone Current Status Transcrobes currently only fully supports learning Chinese for English speakers. If your English is very good then you should be Ok, but otherwise you&amp;rsquo;re better to wait until your preferred language has been implemented. Partial support was developed for Chinese learners of English but has since been put on stand-by. It will be brought back when Chinese for English speakers support is first-class.

      <description>Privacy pages The Transcrobes project contains several sub-projects. Some of these sub-projects have distinct privacy implications and issues, so require specific information. This page provides links to each of the separate privacy pages to allow users/learners to quickly get answers to their privacy-related questions.

      <description>Prerequisites In order for a language pair to be properly supported by the system, two things (currently) need to be accessible and integrated:
  A parts-of-speech parser needs to exist for the learning language. The system (currently) uses the open source Stanford CoreNLP, which (currently) supports English, Chinese, French, German, Spanish and Arabic. Adding support for those learning languages is thus relatively trivial, and probably covers 70-80% of the second languages that people commonly learn.</description>
